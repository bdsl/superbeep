Superbeep

Copyright 2008-2009 Barney Laurance <barney@redmagic.org.uk>

This is a very simple program to emit a beep. It outputs it to the
audio system, rather than attempting to use a PC speaker.

The main feature that as far as I know doesn't exist in any similar
program is the ability to specify the note that the beep should be
played in, using a notation like "f#7" (F-Sharp in octave 7).

To compile:
Install dependancies, if you don't already have them:
        gcc
        libao

On ubuntu, and probably most debian-based systems, you can do:
        apt-get install build-essential libao-dev libao2

Run 'make' to compile the executable.


Usage:

superbeep [option]

Options:
        -n NOTE
                Beep in the NOTE specified, where NOTE is in
                scientific pitch notation. It should start with a
                note letter between a and g, then optionally one or
                more `#' or 'b' symbols, and then an optional octave
                number.

                a4 is defined as the note with frequency 440Hz.
                Each use of `#' increases the pitch by a semitone, and
                each use of `b' reduces the pitch by a semitone. 

        -p PITCH
                beep at the PITCH specified, where PITCH is frequency
                in Hz.

        If neither -n or -p is used then a default pitch of a5 or 880
        Hz is used. Behaviour is undefined if both -n and -p options
        are set.

        -v VOLUME
                beep at the specified VOLUME, where VOLUME is a number
                between 0 and 1.

        -d DURATION
                beep for the specified DURATION, where DURATION is a
                time in seconds
                
These options make it very easy to write a shell script to play a
tune. Examples are encluded that play an A minor harmonic scale,
a blues scale of chords, part of The Blue Danube, and Old Macdonald
Had a Farm.
